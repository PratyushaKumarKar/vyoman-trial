              Recently, there have been significant advances in low-cost sensors (LCS) in air pollution monitoring. Our group is interested in understanding how these tools can help inform more rapid technology assessments or more quickly understand the impact of policy interventions.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have been working with multiple LCS and conducting experiments in locations like New Delhi and Jodphur. A step beyond that, our team has been working on developing indigenous sensors as well.
